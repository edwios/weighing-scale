weighing-scale
==============

Source code for a Spark Core to read from a weigh scale, display the result on an and OLED display and optionally upload the result to the cloud.

The setup utilized a high gain 24-bit ADC HX711 to digitize the amplified voltage difference across a Wheatstone bridge - the "load cell", that measures the weight.

The output of the ADC is read by the Spark Core and in turn displayed on a small, 128x64 OLED display.

Optionally, the measured data can be uploaded to the cloud for other purposes, such as Thingspeak.com for charting (included as sample in source), or pushingbox.com for alerts.
